## Problem 238: Product of Array Except Self

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

### Problem Details

- Name: 238. Product of Array Except Self
- Difficulty: Medium
- [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

### Intuition

The intuition behind this solution is to calculate the product of all elements to the left and all elements to the right of each element in the array, excluding the element itself. We can solve this problem by performing two passes through the array: one to calculate the prefix products and another to calculate the postfix products.

### Approach

The approach involves using two passes through the array. In the first pass, we calculate the prefix products, which represent the product of all elements to the left of the current element. In the second pass, we calculate the postfix products, which represent the product of all elements to the right of the current element. Finally, we combine the prefix and postfix products for each element to get the desired output.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: **O(n)**
  The time complexity of this approach is determined by the two passes through the array, each of which takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

- Space complexity: **O(1)**
  The space complexity is determined by the space required for the `answers` array, which is used to store the final output. Since the `answers` array is not counted towards the space complexity according to the problem constraints, the space complexity is considered as `O(1)`.
